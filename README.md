# Effective-Diffusion 2D
The script Diffsuion2Entropy calculates effective diffusion tensor and entropy production
for a overdamped Brownian system over a tilted periodic potential in 2D

## Entropy production

The full entropy production on the steady state is stored in the variable S_ss

The approximated entropy production from the MTUR is stored in the variable S_cg

The approximated entropy production from the TUR is stored in the varibales S_turx and S_tury
